IMMORTAL OMNISSIAH , HEAR OUR PRAYERS .
WE ARE YOUR CHILDREN , PIOUS SCHOLARS OF THE PATH OF THE MACHINE .
WE PRIZE KNOWLEDGE ABOVE ALL ELSE , FOR IT IS YOUR ETERNAL GIFT UPON MANKIND .
WE ASPIRE TO THE BLESSED FORM OF THE MACHINE , AND ASCENSION THROUGH TECHNOLOGY , THAT WE MIGHT EMULATE THINE GLORY .
SHELTERED BY STEEL , AND PROTECTED BY THINE AVATARS OF WAR , WE PLY THE STARS IN SEARCH OF YOUR LOST GIFTS TO OUR KIND .
MACHINE GOD , WATCH OVER US IN OUR TRAVELS , SHIELD US WITH METAL AND LIGHTNING .
FOR THE UNIVERSE IS AN UNCARING VOID , AND THE WARP HUNGERS FOR US ALL .
TOLL THE GREAT BELL ONCE ! PULL THE LEVER FORWARD TO ENGAGE THE PISTON AND PUMP .
TOLL THE GREAT BELL TWICE ! WITH PUSH OF BUTTON FIRE THE ENGINE AND SPARK TURBINE INTO LIFE .
TOLL THE GREAT BELL THRICE ! SING PRAISE TO THE GOD OF ALL MACHINES !
